				<h2><strong>Cinema Enthusiast!</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I am endlessly fascinated by the power of storytelling through film. Whether it’s analyzing the nuances of a character-driven drama or getting lost in the fantastical worlds of science fiction, cinema serves as both an escape and a lens through which I view the world. I am ended trying to share this passion with my fellow classmates from essec by creating a cinema association.

				<h2><strong>Music! (Piano)</strong></h2>
					<p>
						There’s something truly magical about the piano, the way each note carries its own emotion. I have played the piano for 7 years, and I find solace and joy in the melodies of classical music, losing myself in the works of Chopin, Beethoven. Whether I’m performing for an audience or simply letting the music flow through my fingers in the solitude of my room, playing the piano is a source of endless fulfillment and artistic expression.

				<h2><strong>Travel!</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Travel is the only thing you can buy that makes you richer. Each journey is an opportunity to immerse myself in new cultures, taste exotic cuisines, and forge connections with people from all walks of life.
